    • How can image repetition of the backup be controlled? 

.use the background-repeat property. You can use no-repeat value for the background-repeat property if you do not want to repeat an image, in this case, the image will display only once.


.my-element {
  background-image: url('my-background-image.png');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
